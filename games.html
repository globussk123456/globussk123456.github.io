              <h3>Nintendo</h3>
				<p>It was rumored long before E3 2018 started, but now it’s been confirmed: Battle Royale hit Fortnite is coming to Nintendo Switch and it’s available on the Nintendo Switch eShop right now.

				<p>An inordinate amount of time was spent on Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, but being the biggest SSB game, who can blame 'em?</p> 

				<p>This game includes every single character from the mascot-filled fighting series, including characters that were only available via downloadable content on Wii U, and non-Nintendo characters like Sonic, Pac-Man, and Snake (from Metal Gear Solid).</p>

              <h3>Sony</h3>
				<p>Sony did something different with its PlayStation E3 showcase this year, and whether you liked it or not, it still delivered when it came to great games. </p>
				<p>The Last of Us 2 was treated to a new trailer, one showing Ellie fighting for her life and that perfectly set the tone for the game. </p>

              <h3>Ubisoft</h3>
				<p>Ubisoft's E3 2018 press conference didn't disappoint, with big announcements, new game trailers and even stunts in the theater. </p>
				<p>Finally, Ubisoft ended its keynote with the game everyone is waiting for: Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Set in ancient Greece, you play an outcast Spartan hero, either Alexios or Kassandra. The trailer is gorgeous, of course, and sets the stage for what should be an epic odyssey that's out on October 5.</p>

              <h3>Bethesda</h3>
			  <p>Doom Eternal was announced as a sequel to the 2016 Doom release. This time, hell looks like it's come to Earth. It's dark and depressing, but should make for one heck of a game.</p>
