          <p>
		  While most industry events are drab affairs filled with jetlagged businessmen in crumpled suits, E3 is popping with colour, flair and monstrously decorated stands that fill the 720,000-square foot (67,000-metre squared) of exhibition space at the gigantic Los Angeles Convention Center.It takes 3,000 people to set up the show, which has taken place in California every year since 1995. Organisers recently started admitting members of the public who pay $250 (£187) for an entry ticket and spend up to five hours queuing up for a chance to play the latest games.
          </p>
          <p class="dark">
		  The actual event is only open for three weekdays in June, with many announcements being made at special invite-only conferences hosted by the big video game companies in the days before the show.

            <h3>What Do They Do</h3>
				<p>On the show floor, exhibitors try to out-do each other with stands populated with characters from various games. Lined up on each one are rows and rows of kiosks where fans can play early demos of video games before they're released.</p>
